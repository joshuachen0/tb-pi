# Textbooks
Program to load textbooks onto a USB. Originally written to run continuously on
a Raspberry Pi.

To load textbooks, plug in USB and wait until the files have finished uploading.
Please do not prematurely unplug your USB.

To load new textbooks into the master directory, prepend "new" onto the name of
the PDF file that you would like to upload. Use this with caution, and please
check that the file does not already exist. We don't want unsavory files or
redundancy in something that is meant to be for everyone. I provide a helper 
script to add "new" to the files that you want to add to the master directory.
